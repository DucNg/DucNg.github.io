I'm a fullstack developer based in Paris. I work for a french cybersecurity company.

I used to work for a SAAS startup using Rails, Vue.js and TypeScript (serverless) but now,
I mostly work with Python, Go, still TypeScript, React and Vue.js to build cyber threat intelligence tools.
The deployment is done in Kubernetes.

I'm passionate about open source and especially Linux.

This is my personal blog where I talk about IT related stuff. Mostly Linux and open source software development.
