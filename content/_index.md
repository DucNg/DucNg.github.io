I'm a fullstack developer for a SAAS based software company. I work with Rails, Vue.js and TypeScript (serverless) for my daily job but I'm also a Go developer and Linux enthusiast.

Curious, I want to learn new IT skills and especially in open source software.

This is my personal blog where I talk about IT stuff. Mostly Linux and open source software development.
