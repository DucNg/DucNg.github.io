I’m a 3 years active developer, I develop mostly in Go, Java and JavaScript and I’m using Linux on a daily basis.

Curious, I want to learn new IT skills and especially in open source software.

This is my personal blog where I talk about IT stuff. Mostly Linux and open source software developement.
